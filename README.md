# Neural-network-from-scratch

Created a neural network completely from scratch using only python and numpy and trained it on a small scaled custom made dataset. Also trained a sequential single layered neural network with the same parameters and achieved almost identical results.

The dataset contains 3 features : Age, Affordability, and Bought_insurance

## Custom Neural Network implementation and parameters
### Activation function : Sigmoid
As we have to do a binary prediction of whether someon bought insurance or not, sigmoid would be an ideal choice.
